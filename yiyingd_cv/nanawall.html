			<div class = "col-7">
				<p>In this project, our team did research on Nanawall’s current business strategy and structure to narrow down the ideal feature that fits the business model the best. We use AR technology in this app to help reduce their operational cost. The prototype of the mobile application is been designed in consideration of Nanawall’s target customers and branding. I have taken the role as Project Design Lead.</p>

				<h1>Stakeholder &amp Value</h1>
			</div>
			<div class = "col-7">
				<p>Based on our thorough research, we were able to piece all of our identified stakeholders into six bigger sections (in green) as well as point out all the interactions between the stakeholders (in purple). The graphs are attached down below. Among all of them, there are 2 sections that catches our attention: product making, sales and marketing team. We have noticed that there is a back-and-forth interaction among the three group. Since the current business model is highly depend on actual showroom, the marketing team needs to coordinate the product making team to design and build showrooms to showcase the product in order to persuade customers. However, since customers can have very different needs, there needs to be showrooms in various types to meet most of their requirement. The maintenance fee is high, and sometimes customers are still unsatisfied with what they see.</p>

				<h1>Opportunity &amp solutions</h1>
			</div>
			<div class = "col-7">
				<p>We used the reverse assumption techniques to brainstorm for potential opportunities. We found that, currently, <strong>users cannot visualize</strong> their Nanawall solution until after installation. Along with the high price tag, this inhibits many potential users. Architects also have a <strong>huge time investment</strong> with each potential customer, which can be exacerbated by an undecided customer. Additionally, there are <strong>many company resources invested into 22 showrooms</strong>, such as dedicated architects and showroom managers. 

				Therefore, we proposed the intelligent AR solution. It offers appropriate Nanawall solutions for customer constraints by allowing them to view that solution in AR in their own home or business. The solution eliminates customer apprehension and allows for quicker design decisions. It also reduces internal costs as now fewer types of showrooms are needed.</p>

						<p>We chose a minimalistic design style to cater to the style of our high-end clients. Using a style that’s close to what Nanawall has now can also help to integrate the application with the business. However, some of their design elements in their current website can be more polished (eg. the text’s dark background). We tried to follow their current style and also improved it by focusing on design details and microinteractions.</p>

				<p>We learned quite a few things working on an AR app for an established corporation:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We don’t need a fully functional AR animation just for the sake of demo and getting points across.</li>
					<li>The idea of completely cutting out some established parts of the business (like the showroom visit) is unnecessary and possibly counterproductive. Instead, it makes more sense to try to shorten or make some of the existing steps more efficient.</li>
					<li>Feedback from peers and faculty through the process was helpful to work out details of the prototype before committing resources to hi-fi.</li>
